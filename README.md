# MVC-School-Project
The MVC project is done Spring Boot.
I used JPA, Hibernate, Expresi√≥n regular, Thymeleaf 
In this MVC we can Create,Read,Update and Delete (CRUD) a student where we can assign a subject and from the subject can know the teacher.
The student and teacher inherit of the class Person using  Joined Table Strategy
